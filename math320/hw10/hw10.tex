\subsection*{Problem 1}
{\it Prove the following theorem (terminology is given below):
\begin{center}
	Suppose $X$ is compact and $f \colon X \to \R$ is lower semicontinuous.
	Then $f$ is bounded below on $X$,
	and there exists a point $z \in X$ satisfying $f(z) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in X$.
\end{center}
Recall that in a HTS $(X, \mathcal{T})$, a function $f \colon X \to \R$
is called \emph{lower semicontinuous} if the following set
is closed for every $p \in \R$:
\[
	f^{-1}((-\infty,p]) = \{x \in X \colon f(x) \leq p \}.
\]
(One approach uses the family of closed sets
$f^{-1}((-\infty,p])$ satisfying $p > \inf f(x)$.)}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
	We first prove that $f$ is bounded below on $X$,
	that is, $\inf{f(x)} > -\infty$.
	For the sake of contradiction, assume the opposite, that $\inf{f(x)} = -\infty$.
	Consider $f^{-1}((-\infty, p])$ for some $p \in \R$.
	ff

	Supposedly, we just have $f^{-1}((-\infty,p])^c = f^{-1}((-\infty,p]^c) = f^{-1}((p,\infty))$
	which is open.
	And maybe a union?
	And open covers over all of $X$, and can get a finite subcover.ff

	Consider the family of closed sets of $f^{-1}((-\infty,p])$
	satisfying $p > \inf{f(x)}$, call it $\mathcal{F}$.
	First, remark that each element in $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty,
	otherwise $f^{-1}(-\infty,p])$ is nonempty,
	thus there is no $x_0 \in X$ where $f(x_0) \in (-\infty,p]$
	and so $p \leq \inf{f(x)}$, which we assumed not true.
	Secondly, by the assumption that $f$ is lower semicontinuous,
	each element in $\mathcal{F}$ is also closed.
	Finally, note that $\mathcal{F}$ has the finite intersection property:
	let $N \in \N$ and $F_1, \dots, F_N$ are sets in $\mathcal{F}$,
	which we can write explicitly as $F_i = f^{-1}((-\infty, p_i])$
	where $p_i > \inf{f(x)}$;
	denote $p_0 = \min_i\{p_i\}$.
	Then $F_0 = f^{-1}((-\infty, p_0]) \subseteq F_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq N$,
	and since we're just minimizing over a finite number of sets,
	$F_0 \in \{F_1,\dots,F_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$, thus
	\[
		\bigcap_{i=1}^N F_i = f^{-1}((-\infty,p_o]) = F_0 \neq \emptyset
	\]
	so we have the finite intersection property.

	Now, since we're in a a HTS and $X$ is compact,
	any collection of elements of $\mathcal{F}$ has nonempty intersection,
	by the theorem proved in class
	(every element is a subset of $X$ and are closed,
	and any finite collection has the finite intersection property).
	Notably, $\bigcap \mathcal{F} \neq \emptyset$.
	This means that there exists some $z \in X$ where $z \in \bigcap\mathcal{F}$.
	Then, for all $p > \inf{f(x)}$, we have $z \in f^{-1}((-\infty,p])$.

\subsection*{Problem 2}
{\it Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, with $K \subseteq X$ a compact set.
Prove that whenever $\mathcal{G}$ is an open cover for $K$,
there exists $r < 0$ with this property:
for every pair of points $x,y \in K$ obeying $d(x,y) < r$,
some open set $G \in \mathcal{G}$ contains both $x$ and $y$.}

\begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
	Let $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_N$ be the finite subcover of $K$
	such that $G_i \in \mathcal{G}$ for all $i \in 1,2,\dots,N$
	and $K \subseteq \bigcup_{1\leq i \leq N}G_i$,
	which we know exists from the compactness of $K$.
	Define $I_{i,j} := G_i \cap G_j$ where $1 \leq i < j \leq N$.
	Note then that $I_{i,j}$ is open as well.
	For each $I_{i,j}$, pick some $x_{i,j} \in I_{i,j}$ if $I_{i,j} \neq \emptyset$.
	Then, since $X$ is a metric space and $I_{i,j}$ is an open set,
	we must have that there exists some $r_{i,j} > 0$
	such that $\mathbb{B}[x_{i,j};r_{i,j}) \subseteq I_{i,j}$
	(if $I_{i,j} = \emptyset$, just let $r_{i,j} = 1$).
	Let $r = \min_{1\leq i<j\leq N}\{r_{i,j}\}$.
	Since there are only finitely many $r_{i,j}$, all of them greater than $0$,
	we must have $r > 0$ as well.
	
	Now consider any $x,y \in K$ such that $d(x,y) < r$.
	Consider $\mathbb{B}[x;r)$.
	By our distance condition, we have $y \in \mathbb[x;r)$.
	It is sufficient to show now that there exists some $G \in \mathcal{G}$
	such that $\mathbb{B}[x;r) \subseteq G$.
	Since $\{G_i\}_{1\leq i\leq N}$ is a covering of all of $K$,
	there exists some $G_x \in \{G_i\}_{1\leq i\leq N}$ such that $x \in G_x$.
	If $\mathbb{B}[x;r) \subseteq G_x$, we are done.
	For the sake of contradiction, assume then that $\mathbb{B}[x;r) \not\subseteq G_x$.
	hmm it's not this, it's either in $G_x$, or in $G'_x$...
	consider the $G_i$ for which $x$ is in?

	I don't even have that $\mathbb{B}[x;r) \subseteq K$.
	Hmm, so we don't want to lose $y$, because we'll always have
	$x \in \partial K$ (since $K$ is closed) violate our condition with the ball.
	ff

	So let $x \in G_x$ and $y \in G_y$.
	We claim that either $x \in G_y$ or $y \in G_x$
	(this is trivial if $G_x = G_y$, so we now assume that $G_x \neq G_y$).
	For the sake of contradiction, assume this is false:
	$x, y \not\in G_x \cap G_y$.
	Then by construction, for some $x_{x,y} \in G_x \cap G_y$,
	$x,y \not\in \mathbb{B}[x_{x,y},r)$.
	Then $d(x_{x,y},x) > r$ and $d(x_{x,y},y) > r$.
	We hav $d(x,y) \leq d(x_{x,y},x) + d(x_{x,y},y)$.
	Hmm... the thing on the right is bounded below by $2r$,
	and the thing on the left is bounded above by $r$.
	We want to use this inequality in a different way I think,
	like $d(x_{x,y},x) < d(x,y)$ and $d(x_{x,y},y) < d(x,y)$ somehow.
	Maybe something to do with them being in the same $G_i$?

	So we have $d(x_{x,y}, x) < d(x,y) + d(x_{x,y},y)$.
	But $d(x_{x,y},y) < d(x,y) + d(x_{x,y},x)$, thus
	$d(x_{x,y}, x) < 2d(x,y) + d(x_{x,y},x) \implies 0 < 2d(x,y)$ trivially.
	ff
	So the claim I want to make is that the intersection between
	two open sets in a metric space is closer to each other than
	they are to each other.


	Hmm, we might need to define $r$ in terms of points that are
	not in the same $G_i$, but are close to each other.
	Think of a square donut that his a tiny slit that doesn't touch,
	and an open cover of two sets that intersect on the non-slit side.

	So it seems the problem is when I fix the slit,
	I get a problem with the intersection.
	When I fix the intersection, I get a problem with the slit.
	I will think about this later.


	So Tighe said to do a proof by contradiction.

\subsection*{Problem 3}
{\it Define the set-valued ``projection" mapping
$p_1 \colon \mathcal{P}(\R^2) \to \mathcal{P}(\R)$ by
\[
	p_1(S) = \{x_1 \in \R \colon (x_1,x_2) \in S \text{ for some }x_2\},
	\qquad S \subseteq \R^2
\]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $S$ is bounded, must $p_1(S)$ be bounded? (Why or why not?)
	\item If $S$ is closed, must $p_1(S)$ be closed? (Why or why not?)
	\item If $S$ is compact, must $p_1(S)$ be compact? (Why or why not?)
\end{enumerate}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
		It must. If $S$ is bounded, then by definition,
		there exists $x \in S$ and $R>0$ such that
		$S \subseteq \mathbb{B}[x;R)$.
		Using the the standard metric on $\R^2$
		(namely $d(x,y) = \sqrt{(y_1 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - x_2)^2}$),
		this means for any $y \in S$, we have
		$d(x,y) < r$, or $\sqrt{(y_1 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - x_2)^2} < R$.
		Consider $x_1 = p_1(x)$.
		Then for any $y_1 \in p_1(S)$
		(using the standard metric on $\R$, $d(x,y) = |y-x|$), we have
		\[
			d(x_1,y_1) = |y_1 - x_1| = \sqrt{(y_1-x_1)^2}
			\leq \sqrt{(y_1-x_1)^2 + (y' - x_2)^2} < R
		\]
		where $y' \in p^{-1}(y_1)$,
		and so the last inequality follows from the boundedness of $S$.
		Thus, $p_1(S) \subseteq \mathbb{B}[x_1;R)$,
		so $p_1(S)$ is bounded.
	\end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
		This is not true. We provide the counter-example
		$S = \{(2^{-n}, 2^n) \in \R^2 \colon n \in \N\}$.

		We first prove that $S$ is closed.
		Note that $S' = \emptyset$.
		To see this, for the sake of contradiction, let $s \in S'$.
		Then for some sequence $s_n$ of distinct elements of $S$,
		we have $\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n = s$ (by the proposition proven in class).
		Unraveling the definition of the limit, this means that for
		any $\ep > 0$, there exists some $N \in \N$ where $\forall n \geq N$,
		we have $d(s,s_n) < \ep$.
		For the sake of contradiction, assume that this is true;
		then let $\ep = \frac12$, which gives us some $N$
		where $d(s,s_n) < \frac12$ when $n \geq N$.
		But note that for any $s_n, s_{n+1} \in S$, since $s_n \neq s_{n+1}$,
		we have that $d(s_n, s_{n+1}) > 2$
		(by construction, since $2 \leq 2^{n+1} - 2^n =
		y_{s_{n+1}} - y_{s_{n+1}} = \sqrt{(y_{s_{n+1}} - y_{s_{n+1}})^2}
		\leq \sqrt{(y_{s_{n+1}} - y_{s_{n+1}})^2 + (x_{s_{n+1}} - x_{s_{n+1}})^2} = d(s_n,s_n+1)$).
		Thus $2 \leq d(s_{n+1},s_n) \leq d(s,s_n) + d(s,s_{n+1}) \leq \frac12 + d(s,s_{n+1})
		\implies \frac32  < d(s,s_{n+1})$.
		But this contradicts our assumption, since $n+1 > n \geq N$,
		but $d(s,s_{n+1} > \frac32 > \frac12 = \ep$.
		Thus, there are no limit points of $S$, so $S' = \emptyset$.
		
		Now recall the theorem proven in class, $\overline{S} = S \cup S'$.
		Since $S' = \emptyset$, this leaves us $\overline{S} = S$.
		But recall that this is true only if $S$ is closed.

		We now prove that $p_1(S)$ is not closed.
		Note that $p_1(S) = \{2^{-n} \colon n \in \N\}$.
		See that $0 \in p_1(S)'$ but $0 \not\in p_1(S)$.
		The second of these is obvious, $0 < 2^{-n}$ for all $n \in \N$.
		To see that $0$ is a limit point,
		we have $\lim_{n\to\infty} 2^{-n} = 0$ (obviously, we are in $\R$),
		and $2^{-n} \in p_1(S)$ are distinct points,
		thus $0 \in p_1(S)'$ (by our proposition in metric spaces).
		Thus, $p_1(S) \neq p_1(S) \cup p_1(S)' = \overline{p_1(S)}$.
		But this is true only if $p_1(S)$ is not closed.
		Hence, $S$ is closed but $p_1(S)$ is not closed.
	\end{proof}
	\item \begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
		It must. Assume that $S$ is compact.
		Consider an open cover $\mathcal{G}$ of $p_1(S)$.

\subsection*{Problem 4}
{\it Recall the set $\ell^2$ from HW07 Q3,
and the standard ``unit vectors" $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_p = (0,0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots)$,
where the only nonzero entry in $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_p$ occurs in component $p$.
For any $x$ in $\ell^2$ and subset $V \subseteq \ell^2$, write
\[
	\Omega(x;V) = \{y \in \ell^2 \colon -1 < \langle v,y-x\rangle<1, \forall v \in V\}.
\]
Then define a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $\ell^2$ by saying
$G \in \mathcal{T}$ if and only if every point $x \in G$ has the property
that $x \in \Omega(x;V) \subseteq G$ for some \emph{finite set} $V \subseteq \ell^2$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that $\Omega(x;V) \in \mathcal{T}$ for every finite set
		$V \subseteq \ell^2$ and point $x \in \ell^2$.
	\item Prove that $(\ell^2, \mathcal{T})$ is a Hausdorff Topological Space.
	\item Let $S = \{\hat{\mathbf{e}}_p \colon p \in \N\}$.
		Prove that $0 \in S'$.

			\lVert y - x \rVert < r\}.

		This fact proves that every set considered ``open" in $\mathcal{T}$
		is also open in the metric topology on $\ell^2$.

		We have that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$,

		satisfies our condition to be in $\mathcal{T}$ vacuously.
		We also have $\ell^2 \in \mathcal{T}$,
		since $\Omega(x;V)$ is composed of elements of $\ell^2$,
		and so for any $x \in \ell^2$, $\Omega(x;V) \subseteq \ell^2$.
		
		Now consider $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$.
		Consider an arbitrary element $x \in \bigcup \mathcal{G}$.

		Then $\Omega(x;V) \subseteq G \subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{G}$
		for some finite set $V \subseteq \ell^2$ since $G \in \mathcal{T}$,
		so $\bigcup \mathcal{G} \in \mathcal{T}$ as well.

		Now consider $U_1,\dots,U_N \in \mathcal{T}$ where $N \in \N$.
		Consider an arbitrary element $x \in \bigcap_i^N U_i$.
		Then for all $1 \leq i \leq N$, $x \in U_i$.

	\item \begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
			Let $U \in \mathcal{N}(0)$ be an arbitrary open set,
			ie. $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $0 \in U$.
			We want to show that $(U\setminus\{0\})\cap S \neq \emptyset$;
			since $0 \not\in S$ anyway, we just need to show
			$U \cap S \neq \emptyset$.

			Since $0 \in U$, there exists a finite set $V\subseteq \ell^2$
			such that $\Omega(0;V) \subseteq U$.
			If $V = \emptyset$, then $\Omega(0;V) = \ell^3$
			since $-1 < \langle v, y-x \rangle < 1$ is now
			vacuously true for all $y \in \ell^2$;
			then $\Omega(0;V) \cap S$ since $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1 \in \ell^2 \cap S$,
			and since $\Omega(0;V) \subseteq U$, $U \cap S \neq \emptyset$.
			So now assume $V$ is not empty.
			Denote the elements of $V$ as $v^{i}$ where $1 \leq i \leq k$.
			Then since $v^i \in \ell^2$,
			we must have that $\lim_n (v^i_n)^2 = 0$ (crude divergence test).
			Then there exists some $N_i$ where $(v^i_{N_i})^2 < 1$ by the definition of convergence.
			Let $N = \min_i\{N_i\}$.
			Then $-1 < v^i_N < 1$ as well.
			See
			\[
				\langle v^i, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_N \rangle =
				\sum_{n=1}^\infty v^i_n (\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N)_n
				= v^i_N

			Thus $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N \in \Omega(0,V)$ since
			$-1 < \langle v, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_N - 0 \rangle = v_N < 1$
			for all $v \in V$.
			Thus, $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N \in \Omega(0,V) \subseteq U$.
			Since $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N \in S$,
			thus shows that $S \cap U \neq \emptyset$,
