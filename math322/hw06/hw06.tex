\subsection*{Problem 2 (Ch. 1.7)}
{\it Show that if $G$ is finite and $H$ and $K$ are subgroups
such that $H \supset K$
then $[G:K] = [G:H] [H:K]$.}
\begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
	Using Langrange's theorem (Theorem 1.5) since $G$ is finite:
	\begin{align*}
		|G|
		&= |H|[G:H]\\
		&= |K|[H:K][G:H]
	\end{align*}
	But Lagrange's theorem also says $\frac{|G|}{|K|} = [G:K]$,
	thus
	\[
		[G:K] = [G:H][H:K]
	\]
	as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 3 (Ch. 1.7)}
{\it Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be subgroups of $G$.
Show that any right coset relative to $H_1 \cap H_2$
is the intersection of a right coset of $H_1$ with a right coset of $H_2$.
Use this to prove \emph{Poincar\'{e}'s Theorem}
that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ have finite index in $G$ then so has $H_1 \cap H_2$.}
\begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
	Let $x \in H_1\cap H_2g$ for an arbitrary $g \in G$.
	Then $x = h_{12}g$ for some $h_{12} \in H_1 \cap H_2$.
	But then $x \in H_1g$ since $h_{12} \in H_1$
	and $x \in H_2g$ since $h_{12} \in H_2$.
	Thus $x \in H_1g \cap H_2g$.
	Thus $H_1\cap H_2g \subset \in H_1g \cap H_2g$.
	Since $g$ was arbitrary, we proved this for an arbitrary right coset
	relative to $H_1 \cap H_2$, so this is true for all of them.

	Now let $x \in H_1g_1 \cap H_2g_2$ for arbitrary $g_1,g_2\in G$.
	Then $x = h_1g_1 = h_2g_2$ for some $h_1 \in H_1$, $h_2 \in H_2$.
	Want to show that $h_1,h_2 \in H_1 \cap H_2$.
	Note that $h_1 = (h_2g_2)g_1^{-1} = h_2(g_2g_1^{-1})$.
	But then $h_1$ is in a right coset relative to $H_2$.
	Like wise, $h_2 = h_1(g_1g_2^{-1})$, so $h_2$ is in a right coset relative to $H_1$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 4 (Ch. 1.7)}
{\it Let $G$ be a finitely generated group,
$H$ a subgroup of finite index.
Show that $H$ is finitely generated.}
\begin{proof}[Solution]\let\qed\relax
	ff
	Not as simple as saying $G$ is finitely generated so every subgroup is.
	Could have a finite set of generators be too big for $H$?
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Problem 5 (Ch. 1.7)}
{\it Let $H$ and $K$ be two subgroups of a group $G$.
Show that the set of maps $x \to hxk$, $h \in H$, $k \in K$
is a group of transformatoins of the set $G$.
Show that the orbit of $x$ relative to this group
is the set $HxK = \{hxk \mid h\in H, k\in K\}$.
This is called the \emph{double coset of $x$ relative to the pair $(H,K)$}.
Show that if $G$ is finite then $|HxK| = |H|[K \colon x^{-1}Hx\cap K]
= |K|[H\colon xKx^{-1} \cap H]$.}

\subsection*{Problem 3 (Ch. 1.8)}
{\it Let $G$ be the group of pairs of real numbers $(a,b)$ $a\neq0$,
with the product $(a,b)(c,d) = (ac,ad+b)$ (exercise 4, p.36).
Verify that $K = \{(1,b)\mid b\in\R\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
Show that $G/K \cong (\R^*,\cdot,1)$ the multiplicative group of non-zero reals.}

\subsection*{Problem 5 (Ch. 1.8)}
