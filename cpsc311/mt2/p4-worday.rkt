;; Worday: Word Play Without The "PL"


;; Problem 4a (line 116): complete the design of the slctns function 
;; Problem 4b (line 140): complete the design of the perms function


;; Effect abstractions can be especially useful for designing programs that
;; "normal people"  (unlike us cool PL people) would not consider to count as
;; a programming language (though all data must be interpreted).

;; In this problem, you will exploit a backtracking effect abstraction to
;; implement some programs that are a PITA to implement correctly without it.

;; Effect Abstraction

;;
;; Effect Interface
;;

;; (amb/eff c1 c2) - produce the result of c1 unless it (or its continuation)
;;                   fails, in which case produce the result of c2
;; (fail/eff) - fail the current computation

;; The Generic Interface Components:
;; (return/eff e) - return the value of e
;; (run/eff c n) - run an effectful computation, producing a list of <=n results
;; (let/eff ([x c1] c2)) - bind x to the next successful value of c1 in c2
;; (let/eff* ([x* c1*] ...) c2) - sequentialize instances of let/eff

;; Problem 4a: Complete the design of the slctns function using an effect
;; abstraction to generate the variations.

;; The slctns function produces a list of all possible "selection strings" of
;; characters, in order, from a given string.  A selection keeps some characters
;; and omits others: indeed the name "slctns" is a selection of "selections".
;; As another example, the selections of the string "ape" are
;; 8 strings including "ae", "pe" and "" among them.  In particular,
;; slctns returns (exp 2 (length str)) selection strings for any string str.

;; SlctnComputation is (computationof String)
;; interp. a selection from some input

;; String -> (listof String)
;; produce a list of all selection strings from str
(define (slctns str)
  (local [;; (listof Character) -> SlctnComputation

;; Problem 4b: Complete the design of the perms function
;; NOTE!!!! ONLY WORK ON THIS PROBLEM ONCE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH YOUR
;; WORK ON THE REMAINDER OF THE EXAM.  OUR MARKING SCHEME IS BASED AROUND
;; THAT EXPECTATION


;; The perms function produces a list of all permutations of the given
;; string.  A permutation is a reordering of the given characters.
;; For example, permutations of "ape" are 6 strings including "ape",
;; "pea", and "eap". Note that permutations are of characters, so if you have
;; any repeated characters, then some of your permutations will appear more
;; than once.  In particular In particular, perms returns (fact (length str))
;; strings for any string str.
;; Hint: The model solution to this problem involved an additional helper.

;; PermComputation is (computationof (listof Character))
;; interp. a permutation of some input

;; String -> (listof String)
;; produce a list of all permutations of str
(define (perms str)
  (local [;; (listof Character) -> PermComputation

            (return/eff empty))]
    (let ([char-lists (run/eff (perm/eff (string->list str)) #f)])
      (map list->string char-lists))))
