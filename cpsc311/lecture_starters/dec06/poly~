;; Can you give this types? If so, what types could you give this?
'{{fixFun {f : _} {x} x} {fixFun {f : _} {x} x}}

'{{fixFun {f : (X -> X) -> (X -> X)} {x} x} {fixFun {f : X -> X} {x} x}}
;;Type must be a function, because fixFun... but also first one is operator
;; and then returning itself

'{{fixFun {f : (number -> number) -> (number -> number)} {x} x}
  {fixFun {f : number -> number} {x} x}}
;; in TEMU (explicit), we must have a type... the whole point of today's
;; lecture is fixing this

;; Wouldn't it be nice to not have to commit?
