In this homework, we will need several definitions. Let $I=[a,b]$ be an interval and $k\geq 0$ be an integer. If $f\colon I\to\RR$ is a function that is $k$-times differentiable on $I$, then we define
\[
\Vert f \Vert_{C^k(I)}=\sum_{j=0}^k \sup_{x\in I} |f^{(j)}(x)|.
\]
This quantity is called the ``$C^k$ norm of $f$.'' We define $C^k(I)$ to be the set of functions $f\colon I\to\RR$ that satisfy the following two properties. (i): $f$ is $k$-times differentiable on $I$, and (ii): $f^{(k)}$ is continuous on $I$. We define a metric on $C^k(I)$ as follows: $d(f,g)=\Vert f-g \Vert_{C^k(I)}$, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{CkNorm}
d(f,g) = \sum_{j=0}^k \sup_{x\in I} |f^{(j)}(x)-g^{(j)}(x)|.
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to verify that this is indeed a metric, but you do not have to do so for this homework.

\begin{problem}
Let $f(t) = e^t$; recall that $f$ is monotone increasing, $f'(t) = f(t)$, and $f(0)=1$. Let $P_n(t)$ be the $n$-th order Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $x_0=0$, as discussed in lecture. Let $I=[-1,1]$ and let $k\geq 1$ be an integer. 

Using Taylor's theorem, prove that the sequence $\{P_n\}$ converges to $f$ in the metric space $C^k(I)$.

\noindent\emph{Hints} (i) Compute the Taylor polynomial $P_n(t)$. (ii) What is the derivative of $P_n$? (iii) What are the higher derivatives of $P_n$? (iv) How can you estimate each term in \eqref{CkNorm}?

\begin{problem}
Let $f(t) = e^t$. Let $P_n(t)$ be the $n$-th order Taylor polynomial of $f$ at the point $x_0=0$.

\medskip

\noindent a) Let $n\geq 1$. Prove that $n!P_n(1)$ is an integer.

\medskip

\noindent b) Using part a) and Taylor's theorem, prove that Euler's number $e$ is irrational. You may use the fact that $e^t$ is strictly monotone increasing, and $0<e<3$.\\
\emph{Hint}: if $e$ were rational, then we could write $e=m/n$....

The next problem concerns monotone increasing functions, and will help prepare us for the Riemannâ€“Stieltjes integral. Let $\alpha\colon [0,1]\to\RR$ be increasing. Recall from last term that for every $c\in[0,1]$, $\lim_{x\searrow c}\alpha(x)$ and $\lim_{x\nearrow c}\alpha(x)$ always exist. Thus $\alpha$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if $\lim_{x\searrow c}\alpha(x)=\lim_{x\nearrow c}\alpha(x)$. If $\alpha$ is not continuous at $c$, then $\lim_{x\nearrow c}\alpha(x) < \lim_{x\searrow c}\alpha(x)$, and we say $\alpha$ has a \emph{jump discontinuity} at $c$.

\begin{problem}
Let $\alpha\colon [0,1]\to\RR$ be montone increasing. Prove that the set of points $c\in [0,1]$ where $\alpha$ is not continuous is either finite (possibly empty), or countably infinite.
\end{problem}
